--These following notes appear in all readmes for managing AutoCAD at Legrand, Wattstopper.
--This article explains the Philosophy of CUI's and AutoCAD more in depth.

--Header for all Edit's
--
--It's recommended that only one person makes changes to these files here because they are defaults for all customers:
--C:\WS_Blocks
--It's recommended that each customer is allowed to make changes here:
--C:\WS_Blocks_Customizations

--Header for CUI Edit's
--Before you make any edits to CUI files you'll need to understand four concepts:
--
--1.) The difference between a main customization file and a enterprise customization file.
--CUI stands for Custom User Interface, so these files contain everything needed to add functionality to the AutoCAD customer Interface.
--There are many types of settings that can be changed inside of a cui file.
--Most important are workspaces and toolbars.
--You can create a cui file with as few or as many edits as you like and then load them into a bigger cui file.
--In some cases, after you load whatever is in the smaller cui into the larger cui, the smaller file is no longer needed (such as workspaces and toolbars).
--The advantage with making several files that work together in unison is portability and longevity.
--Also, AutoCAD can support multiple office locations which may have individual needs based on certains settings.
--Grouping common items in separate cui files (such as toolbars and workspaces in their own files) makeS swapping them out inside the main cui file easier.
--Keeping the main cui file definition as empty and clean as possible is best.
--Also using a created cui file as the main file is better than using the default one for AutoCAD.
--This way the default AutoCAD Main cui (ACAD.cuix) will not get contaminated.
--That file mentioned above is stored inside the support structure that is standard to AutoCAD.
--
--2.) What a cui file is and what can be contained inside of one.
--Main customization files are unprotected inside of CAD and can be changed at anytime.
--Main serves as a great location for a clean cui file so the customers can change it as they need to on a individual basis.
--Main works best when it is used as a space to load standard functionality while giving the customer flexibility to move items.
--Enterprise customization files are read-only inside of CAD.
--Enterprise serves as a great location for anything that needs to be standard and locked in place across all customers machines.
--Enterprise items cannot be moved or edited at any point.
--Every cui file has the potential to be loaded in either slot, main or enterprise.
--
--3.) The support paths under options inside of AutoCAD determine what is a main cui and what is a enterprise cui.
--The LISP routines set how each cui file is loaded.
--The acadoptions.lsp file sets all options file paths for each AutoCAD session.
--C:\WS_Blocks\LISP\acadoptions.lsp
--
--4.) It is possible to edit an enterprise cui file. You just have to change it to be loaded as a main cui.
--To edit the Enterprise Customization file, Wattstopper.cuix, first you must load it into the main slot.
--From there you can make changes, save it, then switch it back to the enterprise slot to protect it.
