Only 1 responsibility for Application Engineers:

1.)		Make sure to use VMAIN and then VCONTROLLER, in that order, for any devices you want to wire
		(first) VMAIN
		(second) VCONTROLLER
		Rememeber to always use VMAIN first, it resets data inside the blocks that VCONTROLLER uses.
		This is especially important on revisions.
		Anyime you increase the number of Main panels and then redistribute the Secondary, Auxiliary and Station Bus connections it's required to use:
		VMAIN followed by VCONTROLLER so the data is valid.
		
Rules coded into VMAIN function:
		
Enclosure Connections
	Main to Main
		Wire								Controller Bus
		Max number of runs						1 Controller Bus run, 1 connnection in and out of each main panel
		Max quantity of devices per run					31 Main Enclosures, a main enclosure has exactly 1 IC-36 or IC-24 processor in it
		Max wire distance per run					2000 feet total wire distance on run
		Max wire distance between devices on run			no limit, other than above condition
		
		
	Main to Secondary
		Wire								Enclosure Bus
		Max number of runs						3 Enclosure Bus runs from each Main
		Max quantity of devices per run					2 Secondaries per Enclosure Bus run
		Max quantity of devices						6 Secondaries total from any Main
		Max wire distance per run					200 feet total wire distance on run
		Max wire distance between devices on run			no limit, other than above condition
		
	Main to Auxiliary (used to send data into block)
		Wire								N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max number of runs						N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max quantity of devices per run					N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max quantity of devices						N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max wire distance per run					N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max wire distance between devices on run			2666 feet between Auxiliary and Main
		
	Panel to Component (used to send data into block)
		Wire								N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max number of runs						N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max quantity of devices per run					N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max quantity of devices						Panel specific (code will determine max number of modules, LVOS, and Controllers)
		Max wire distance per run					N/A, connection shown for Application Engineer only
		Max wire distance between devices on run			6 feet, to ensure panel doesn't wire to a component in another room
			
Station Connections	

	Controller to Station Bus device
		Wire								Station Bus
		Max number of runs						Controller specific (the code will determine)
		Max quantity of devices per run					Controller specific (the code will determine)
		Max quantity of devices						no limit, other than above condition
		Max wire distance per run					Controller specific (the code will determine)
		Max wire distance between devices on run			no limit, other than above condition
		
	Station Bus device to Station Bus device
		Wire								Station Bus
		Max quantity of devices per run					Controller specific (the code will determine)
		Max wire distance per run					Controller specific (the code will determine)
		Max wire distance between devices on run			no limit, other than above condition
