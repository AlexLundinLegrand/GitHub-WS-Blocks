VMAIN pseudocode

Prompt user to select all blocks wired together

If set has a main
	Create list for panel connections
	
	
	Connect main to nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
	Remove panel components from list of panel components
		Connect to next nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
		Remove panel components from list of panel components
	
	
	Loop to connect main to 3 closest secondaries
		Remove secondary from list of secondaries
		connect secondary to nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
		Remove panel components from list of panel components
			connect to next nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
			Remove panel components from list of panel components

	Loop to connect each secondary to closest secondary
		Remove secondary from list of secondaries
		connect secondary to nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
		Remove panel components from list of panel components
			connect to next nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
			Remove panel components from list of panel components
	
	Connect main to closest aux
	Remove aux from list for panel connections
		connect aux to nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
		Remove panel components from list of panel components
			connect to next nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]	
			Remove panel components from list of panel components


	Loop to connect aux to next closest aux
		Remove aux from list for panel connections
		connect aux to nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
		Remove panel components from list of panel components
			connect to next nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]	
			Remove panel components from list of panel components
	
	
Else set doesn't have main
	Create list for panel connections
	
	Loop to connect aux to next closest aux
		Remove aux from list for panel connections
		connect aux to nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]
		Remove panel components from list of panel components
			connect to next nearest panel component [4ft saftey factor]	
			Remove panel components from list of panel components
