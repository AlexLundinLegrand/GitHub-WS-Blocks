There are 3 root folders:

C:\WS_Blocks\Autosaves
C:\WS_Blocks\Custom
C:\WS_Blocks\Default

Location of Standard Work, Room Details Index and Room Details Template:
C:\WS_Blocks\Default\CAD Documentation\Standard Work
C:\WS_Blocks\Default\CAD Documentation\Standard Work\Room Detail Index.xls
C:\WS_Blocks\Default\Templates\RD-DLM.dwg

Locaton of Setup Documents:
C:\WS_Blocks\Default\CAD Documentation\AutoCAD Setup Documents

Locations of Tool Palette Groups for importing:
C:\WS_Blocks\Default\ToolPallete\Palettes
Default Palette Group.xpg
C:\WS_Blocks\Custom\ToolPallete\Palettes
Custom Palette Group.xpg

Locations of drawing Templates:
C:\WS_Blocks\Default\Templates

Information about network drive locations.
Only copy the WS_Blocks folder from these two locations:
H:\Drawings
P:\1 AutoCAD Main

You can also use the windows batch processes to get enhancments quickly
Close AutoCAD and then copy one of these locations into windows explorer
H:\Drawings\WS_Blocks_Weekly.bat
P:\Drawings\WS_Blocks_Weekly.bat
